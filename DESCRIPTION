Description: Computes the overlap of time series describing the presence
    or abundance of two species, for example to analyse how weather affect the
    overlap between a plant and its pollinator. Data are (optionally) interpolated
    between observations, PDFs are fitted by kernel density or to a pre-specificied
    distribution. Several measures of overlap are available.
