This vignette covers ....

## Example data

A small set of annotated example trees are included in the `phenologyOverlap` package.


```{r, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load required packages
library(MASS)

# Load example data
data(mcycle)

hist(rnorm(100))
```

Some equations are always useful:
$$\hat{o} = f(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)$$
